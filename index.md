## General Information
The purpose of the conference is to promote the research on the emerging field of interface of statistics and geometry among researchers in China and beyond. This is a continuous effort, following the recent Harvard conference on geometry and statistics. Anyone who has received a Ph.D. or expects to receive a Ph.D. by the end of 2023 in the relevant field is eligible to attend, though participation is by invitation only. Participants from under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply.

The conference will take place at the Yanqi Lake Beijing Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Applications (BIMSA), sponsored by BIMSA and the Yau Center at Tsinghua University, during July 23 - 25, 2023.
